To push your Football Bot to GitHub:

1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "Football_bot" or your preferred name
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Create the repository

2. Add the remote repository (replace placeholders):
   
   For HTTPS:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   
   For SSH:
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repository-name>.git

3. Rename branch to main (GitHub's default):
   git branch -M main

4. Push the code:
   git push -u origin main

Example (if your username is "alextrx818" and repo is "Football_bot"):
   git remote add origin https://github.com/alextrx818/Football_bot.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

After pushing, your code will be available at:
https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>
